## TODO
Explain why [Todd McLeod](https://twitter.com/todd_mclead)'s [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code) is one of the best I've taken. Ever. For any language.

 ## Things I've learnt.
 1. When setting up Github, ensure that you've generated a [new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and added it to your SSH agent, keychain, and Github user account.
 2. Check your remote repository URLs and change from [HTTPS to SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#switching-remote-urls-from-https-to-ssh) if necessary ... if you don't, you'll likely get errors when you try to push.
 3. There are many reasons to love [OhMyZsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) which offers plugins galore, including the hugely useful [Github short commands](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Oh-My-Zsh_Git.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index).
 4. If you're not using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), well ... you really should be.
 5. Spelling mistakes have been the cause of almost **all** of the mistakes I've made ... and, through these mistakes, much of the learning and progress I've made.

7. Using extentions will supercharge your developer workflow.
